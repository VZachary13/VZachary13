Hi my name is Vinicius Zachary
I'm interested in Cybersecurity and Programming
I'm currently studying to get a degree in cybersecurity with an engineering focus
most of my classwork is programming
I'm looking for an entry-level programming position while I work on my cybersecurity degree
My github is going to essentially be my portfolio and proof of my familiarity with github

If there is any need to reach me, call me or beep me at vinicius.zachary@gmail.com
